Humans will use it, for instance, to identify and assess opportunities to turn waste into a resource, and to reorganize work to minimize carbon footprints. Access to these benefits will be as simple as selecting and configuring Apps from an online store and interoperability minimizes vendor-lock-in and maximizes information valorization. New AI-focused training services for employees will be a general practice too. They let workers experience solutions and teach them about the capabilities, risks, and limitations of AI in manufacturing. Digital assistance solutions will blend into Europeâ€™s emerging legal framework for AI and they will be affordable and manageable even by small producers.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/wasabi.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/wasabi.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Wasabi Project Logo" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </body></html>
