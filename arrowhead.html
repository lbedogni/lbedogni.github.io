The idea lies in the different data that are produced by different services and platforms, which thanks to a common interface and an interoperable protocol are able to be seamlessly integrated between each other.</p> <p><a href="https://www.arrowheadproject.eu/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Arrowhead project website</a></p> <p>Arrowhead is addressing efficiency and flexibility at the global scale by means of collaborative automation for five application verticals. That means production (manufacturing, process, energy), smart buildings and infrastructures, electro-mobility and virtual market of energy.</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/arrowhead_overview.png" sizes="95vw"></source> <img src="/assets/img/arrowhead_overview.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="Arrowhead Overview" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> <p>Credits: The Arrowhead project</p> </body></html>
