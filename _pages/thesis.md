Here you can find a list of available Bachelor and Master thesis available, along with internships. There may be also novel projects available, so please check with me if you are interested in the topics I work on.

General rules for taking an internship or thesis work with me

I am always happy to work with Bachelor and Master students, and I am glad that you are considering one of the topic I propose. Undergoing a thesis work is a key step in your education, and it is a challenging yet rewarding experience. The following rules are meant to be a guideline so that both you and me can carry the project in an efficient manner.

* <b><u>Take your time</u></b>: a good bachelor thesis requires around 3 months, while a Master thesis can take 6 months or even more. If you are interested in one or more topics, ask in advance, even if you have not finished your exams yet. Moreover, if you are interested in one of the topics listed in this pages, say it upfront.
* <b><u>Be efficient with communication</u></b>: when reporting your work, one email per month is too few, one per day is too much. Be efficient in what you communicate and how you do so.
* <b><u>I am not gdb (or similar)</u></b>: do not send me code saying “it does not work”. Explain what you have tried, on what circumstances you experience any problem. Be proactive, be clear.
* <b><u>How to write</u></b>: we will use LaTeX, which may seem difficult at the beginning but you will benefit a lot from it at the later stages. A good tool to share the thesis work is Overleaf.
* <b><u>The Internship/thesis is YOUR responsibility</u></b>: I will not remind you about deadlines, documents to fill, bureaucracy and alike. It is your responsibility to perform these tasks.
