abstract = {Mobile Crowdsensing has become an important paradigm in the last decade for on-demand monitoring scenarios in Smart Cities and vehicular networks, when the deployment of a dedicated sensor network is no longer affordable. To foster the participation of a large user base, it is common to reward them on top of the amount and the quality of data provided. Regardless of the MCS policy adopted, this requires the crowdsourcer to keep track of the participants. Since the contributed data inherently carries sensitive spatio-temporal information, privacy problems arise if a malicious entity gains access to it; still, in some cases, the spatio-temporal precision is crucial for the benefit of the application and cannot be distorted. In this paper we propose a privacy preserving framework for opportunistic MCS scenarios that includes data collection and rewarding phases. The framework both retains the precision of spatio-temporal information and limits the sensitivity of information disclosed through an algorithm that clusters the data points into low correlated sets. The framework is agnostic about how correlation is calculated, and we propose three exemplary correlation functions. We evaluate our framework against six real world datasets, assessing its efficacy and envisioning its implementation in practical deployments.}

ABSTRACT="Pervasive devices are now part of daily lives for a multitude of human
beings, due to their ability to perform simple to more complex tasks.
Scenarios like Industry 4.0 and drone delivery are only few of the several
ones which benefit from autonomous and modern smart devices. Due to their
tasks, almost all of these devices are battery powered, with some of them
for which it is hard to preventively maintain it. Most of the works which
tackles this problem rely on processes which could be unpractical in the
real world due to complexity, time or cost constraints. In this paper we
propose a novel methodology which leverages few data obtained from normal
charge and discharge cycles to diagnose the current battery for power fade
faults and possibly perform maintenance before service interruption occurs.
Tests performed on a real dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our
approach."

ABSTRACT="The recognition of the activity of texting while driving is an open problem
in literature and it is crucial for the security within the scope of
automotive. This can bring to live new insurance policies and increase the
overall safety on the roads.
    Many works in literature leverage smartphone sensors to do this,
however it is shown that these methods take a considerable amount of time
to perform a recognition with sufficient confidence. In this paper we
propose to leverage the smartphone front camera to perform an image
classification and recognize whether the subject is seated in the driver
position or in the passenger position. We first applied standalone
Convolutional Neural Networks with poor results, then we focused on object
recognition-based algorithms to detect the presence and position of
discriminant objects (i.e. the security belts and the car window). We then
applied the model over short videos by classifying frame by frame until
reaching a satisfactory confidence. Results show that we are able to reach
around 90\\% accuracy in only few seconds of the video, demonstrating the
applicability of our method in the real world."

abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution has led to the adoption of novel technologies and methodologies in factories, making these more efficient and productive. Among the new services which are changing industry, there are those based on machine learning algorithms, which enable machines to learn from their past observations and hence possibly forecast future states. Specifically, predictive maintenance represents the opportunity to understand in advance possible machine outages due to broken parts and schedule the necessary maintenance operations. However, in real scenarios predictive maintenance struggles to be adopted due to a multitude of variables and the heavy customization it requires. In this work, we propose a novel framework for predictive maintenance, which is trained online to recognize new issues reported by the operators. Our framework, tested on different scenarios and with a varying number and several kinds of sensors, shows recall levels above 0.85, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability.},
