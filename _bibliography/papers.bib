ABSTRACT="Pervasive devices are now part of daily lives for a multitude of human
beings, due to their ability to perform simple to more complex tasks.
Scenarios like Industry 4.0 and drone delivery are only few of the several
ones which benefit from autonomous and modern smart devices. Due to their
tasks, almost all of these devices are battery powered, with some of them
for which it is hard to preventively maintain it. Most of the works which
tackles this problem rely on processes which could be unpractical in the
real world due to complexity, time or cost constraints. In this paper we
propose a novel methodology which leverages few data obtained from normal
charge and discharge cycles to diagnose the current battery for power fade
faults and possibly perform maintenance before service interruption occurs.
Tests performed on a real dataset demonstrate the feasibility of our
approach."

AUTHOR="Federico Montori and Marco Spallone and Luca Bedogni",
TITLE="Texting and Driving Recognition leveraging the Front Camera of Smartphones",
BOOKTITLE="2023 IEEE 20th Consumer Communications \& Networking Conference (CCNC)
(CCNC 2023)",

KEYWORDS="image recognition; object detection; internet of things",
ABSTRACT="The recognition of the activity of texting while driving is an open problem
in literature and it is crucial for the security within the scope of
automotive. This can bring to live new insurance policies and increase the
overall safety on the roads.
    Many works in literature leverage smartphone sensors to do this,
however it is shown that these methods take a considerable amount of time
to perform a recognition with sufficient confidence. In this paper we
propose to leverage the smartphone front camera to perform an image
classification and recognize whether the subject is seated in the driver
position or in the passenger position. We first applied standalone
Convolutional Neural Networks with poor results, then we focused on object
recognition-based algorithms to detect the presence and position of
discriminant objects (i.e. the security belts and the car window). We then
applied the model over short videos by classifying frame by frame until
reaching a satisfactory confidence. Results show that we are able to reach
around 90\\% accuracy in only few seconds of the video, demonstrating the
applicability of our method in the real world."
