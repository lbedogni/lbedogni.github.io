The Arrowhead project aims at increasing the interoperability of services, mainly for 5 different use-cases: production processes, smart buildings and infrastructures, electro-mobility and virtual market of energy. The idea lies in the different data that are produced by different services and platforms, which thanks to a common interface and an interoperable protocol are able to be seamlessly integrated between each other.

Arrowhead is addressing efficiency and flexibility at the global scale by means of collaborative automation for five application verticals. That means production (manufacturing, process, energy), smart buildings and infrastructures, electro-mobility and virtual market of energy.
