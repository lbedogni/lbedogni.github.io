The Arrowhead project aims at increasing the interoperability of services, mainly for 5 different use-cases: production processes, smart buildings and infrastructures, electro-mobility and virtual market of energy. The idea lies in the different data that are produced by different services and platforms, which thanks to a common interface and an interoperable protocol are able to be seamlessly integrated between each other.
