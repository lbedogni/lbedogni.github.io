The STEM-Net project, Stem devices for wireless auto-organizing networks, is a PRIN project aiming at developing novel algorithms for auto-organizing networks, also using drones and mobile robots, particularly for the disaster scenario. The reconfiguration of the devices happens at different levels of the protocol stack. The project has been developed by three universities, University of Bologna, University Mediterranea Reggio Calabria, University of Calabria.
