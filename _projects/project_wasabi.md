The WASABI vision is that digital assistance and conversational AI become standard practices to reach sustainability goals in manufacturing. Humans will use it, for instance, to identify and assess opportunities to turn waste into a resource, and to reorganize work to minimize carbon footprints. Access to these benefits will be as simple as selecting and configuring Apps from an online store and interoperability minimizes vendor-lock-in and maximizes information valorization. New AI-focused training services for employees will be a general practice too. They let workers experience solutions and teach them about the capabilities, risks, and limitations of AI in manufacturing. Digital assistance solutions will blend into Europeâ€™s emerging legal framework for AI and they will be affordable and manageable even by small producers.
