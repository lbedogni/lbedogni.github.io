The objective of the Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) project is to determine any anomaly on a TFT screen of various sizes (from 7 inches up to 21). The solution we have adopted employs auto-encoders run on specific Intel hardware (Intel Movidius Compute stick), to analyze and identify any possible defect. We collect images from a digital linear 4K camera, and compare those images against a pre-trained model to identify differences. The output of the work is then fed to an operator, which can decide whether to pass or block the TFT.
