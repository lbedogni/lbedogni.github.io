Crowdsensing systems collect data from users, through their smartphone or any other capable device. The data collected with this methodology can highlight pattern in an area of interest, and is in general a welcome solution for many different use cases. 

Crowdsensing system present several challenges. Please refer to the following publications for an overview of the recent research performed in this field.
