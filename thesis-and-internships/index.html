<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>Here you can find a list of available Bachelor and Master thesis available, along with internships. There may be also novel projects available, so please check with me if you are interested in the topics I work on.</p> <p>General rules for taking an internship or thesis work with me</p> <p>I am always happy to work with Bachelor and Master students, and I am glad that you are considering one of the topic I propose. Undergoing a thesis work is a key step in your education, and it is a challenging yet rewarding experience. The following rules are meant to be a guideline so that both you and me can carry the project in an efficient manner.</p> <ul> <li> <b><u>Take your time</u></b>: a good bachelor thesis requires around 3 months, while a Master thesis can take 6 months or even more. If you are interested in one or more topics, ask in advance, even if you have not finished your exams yet. Moreover, if you are interested in one of the topics listed in this pages, say it upfront.</li> <li> <b><u>Be efficient with communication</u></b>: when reporting your work, one email per month is too few, one per day is too much. Be efficient in what you communicate and how you do so.</li> <li> <b><u>I am not gdb (or similar)</u></b>: do not send me code saying “it does not work”. Explain what you have tried, on what circumstances you experience any problem. Be proactive, be clear.</li> <li> <b><u>How to write</u></b>: we will use LaTeX, which may seem difficult at the beginning but you will benefit a lot from it at the later stages. A good tool to share the thesis work is Overleaf.</li> <li> <b><u>The Internship/thesis is YOUR responsibility</u></b>: I will not remind you about deadlines, documents to fill, bureaucracy and alike. It is your responsibility to perform these tasks.</li> </ul> <hr> <h1>Internships with Industries</h1> <table style="border:solid"> <tr> <th>B.Sc./M.Sc.</th> <th>Title</th> <th>Abstract</th> <th>Partners</th> <th>Topics</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Bachelor/Master</td> <td>Packet fall detection</td> <td>The goal of this internship is to develop a vision system to track packets and boxes which fall from pallets, to notify operators to fix the issue. </td> <td>Kosme Srl</td> <td>AI</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bachelor/Master</td> <td>Packets on pallets stability</td> <td>The goal of this internship is to analyze a vast dataset of issues related to pallets building, to find patterns about issues related to packets and boxes falling from them.</td> <td>Kosme Srl</td> <td>AI, Data Science</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bachelor/Master</td> <td>Supply chain traceability with blockchain</td> <td>The goal of this industry related internship is to develop a traceability system integrated with a Blockchain, to guarantee transparency to the end user. </td> <td>DIGIBELT Srl (BO)</td> <td>IoT, Industry 4.0, Blockchain</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bachelor/Master</td> <td>Machine based analysis on production data</td> <td>This work focuses on data analysis for production processes, to analyze large quantities of data and to assess patterns within them.</td> <td>DIGIBELT Srl (BO)</td> <td>IoT, Data Science</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bachelor/Master</td> <td>Automatic generation of corrective actions in Industry 4.0</td> <td>Through the analysis of sensor data and actions performed by operators, this work focuses on the automatic recognition of patterns which have to be translated into automated actions.</td> <td>DIGIBELT Srl (BO)</td> <td>AI, WoT</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bachelor/Master</td> <td>Automatic classification of issues in Smart Cities</td> <td>Through the analysis of images, this thesis focuses on the classification of issues in smart cities such as potholes, broken trees, waste and alike.
